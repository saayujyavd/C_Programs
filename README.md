This repository contains the projects I made in the C Programming Language

Getting Started:

Prerequisites
You'll need a C compiler installed on your system. GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) is a popular choice and is available for most operating systems.

Linux: GCC is often pre-installed. You can install it using your distribution's package manager (e.g., sudo apt-get install build-essential for Debian/Ubuntu).

Windows: You can use MinGW-w64 or install a complete development environment like Visual Studio with C++ desktop development.

macOS: You can install the Xcode Command Line Tools by running xcode-select --install in your terminal, which includes GCC.

Compiling and Running a Program:

Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/c-programs.git
cd c-programs

Navigate to a program's directory. For example, to compile a program in the basics folder:
cd basics/

Compile the program using GCC. The -o flag specifies the output filename.
gcc hello_world.c -o hello

Run the executable:
./hello

Thankyou!
