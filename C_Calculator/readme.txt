		The Reverse Polish Calculator by SAAYUJYA V. DESHPANDE

This is a rudimentary mathematical expression evaluator (calculator),
which evaluates only those expressions which contain the '+', '-', '*', and '/', operators.

It can evaluate all real numbers, but it does not have
the functionality to evaluate any brackets first.

I have mentioned a hypothetical organisation in the code (K&R Corporation),
it's nothing but credit given to Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie,
since I made the calculator while reading their book 'The C Programming Language'.

Thankyou!
